# rss-reader

This is the front end portion of the RSS reader app that I made. It utilizes NextJS coupled with Chakra-ui. This is a side project mainly for hobby stuff but I will probably deploy this sometime and link it in the few repos that exist for it.

## Tech
- NextJS
- React
- TypeScript
- GraphQL
- Chakra-UI : CSS framework
- urql : GraphQL client
- xml2js : for parsing xml data

## Current functionality
- Register Users
- Login & Logout
- Add Feeds
- Read Feeds
- Various UI muck

## Future possible features
- Close additions:
  - Deleting or deactivating ones account
  - Updating account information
  - Deleting feeds
  - Updating feeds
- A bit later:
  - Lost password tool
  - Additional account information
- Future-future (will probably lose interest or time):
  - Additional nonsense features like friend features
  - Sharing features
  - SSO
