# rss-reader

This is the front end portion of the RSS reader app that I made. It utilizes NextJS coupled with Chakra-ui. This is a side project mainly for hobby stuff but I will probably deploy this sometime and link it in the few repos that exist for it.

## Tech
- NextJS
- React
- TypeScript
- GraphQL
- Chakra-UI : CSS framework
- urql : GraphQL client
- xml2js : for parsing xml data

## Functionality
For a list of functionality, please checkout the [rss-reader](https://github.com/ryanchew3/rss-reader) repo.
